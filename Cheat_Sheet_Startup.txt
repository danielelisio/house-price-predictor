# App Startup Cheat Sheet

## 🟢 Start the App (build and run in background)
```
docker-compose up -d --build
```
- Rebuilds images and starts all services in the background.

## 🟢 Start the App (if no code changes)
```
docker-compose up -d
```
- Starts services in the background using existing images.

## 🛑 Stop the App
```
docker-compose down
```
- Stops and removes all running containers.

## 🧹 View Logs
```
docker-compose logs -f
```
- Shows real-time logs for all services.

## 🌐 Access the App
- Streamlit UI: http://localhost:8501
- FastAPI docs: http://localhost:8002

## 🧑‍💻 Common Troubleshooting
- If you get a port conflict, make sure no other app is using the same port.
- If you change code, always use `--build` to rebuild images.
